# Boomgala Smart Sontracts
This is the boomgala smart contracts repo

## ERC721A
- ERC721A is an implementation of IERC721 with significant gas savings for minting multiple NFTs in a single transaction.
- The BoomGala contract will enable minting multiple NFTs for essentially the same cost of minting a single NFT.
- ERC721A is audited with an external security consultant to ensure the approach is sound.
- We believe the broader community to use this implementation to save gas costs for their users.

## Boomgala NFTs
